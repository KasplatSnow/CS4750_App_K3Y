# CS4750_App_K3Y
Application for CS4750. Named K3Y that generates memorizable but secure passwords.

The application in this iteration will take user specifications and generate a password that can be secure but easy to memorize for most. The user can input the desired minimum length of the password, then the base word which the program will generate around, the minimum amount of special characters, the minimum amount of uppercase letters, and then finally minimum amount of lowercase letters. It will check to see if the specifications are feasible, and then generate a new password. The generated password will be displayed on the next page, where the user can copy it to save it elsewhere, or go back to the previosu page to regenerate the password.
